  shortSummary:
    "I work at the intersection of mainframe engineering and modern AI. From COBOL and JCL on z/OS to Java, Python, and LLM-based systems, I focus on solving problems across technology generations. Currently exploring agentic engineering and modern tooling for z/OS bringing automation, intelligence, and developer experience to systems built long before today's AI era.",

  summary:
    "Software developer with hands-on experience across Java, Python, AI, and IBM Z technologies. I build and experiment with software across application development, AI, and enterprise systems. My Java work includes JavaFX applications and a cosine-similarity based plagiarism detection system. In Python, I've developed LLM-powered tools focused on practical automation and document processing. On IBM z/OS, I work with COBOL, JCL, DB2, and VSAM, including end-to-end batch processing and job execution. Alongside development, I contribute to the IBM Z community through technical writing and my involvement in the IBM Z Advocacy Program. I'm also exploring LLM agents, Zowe, and modern approaches to connecting mainframe environments with contemporary developer tooling. Outside of core development, I'm exploring quantitative research through WorldQuant BRAIN — building and testing alpha signals as a way to sharpen my data and statistical thinking. My focus is on building reliable software, understanding systems at a deeper level, and continuously working across technologies that solve real engineering problems.",
